Dear Professor #=lastname=#,
 
Greetings!  Your SUMMER 2012 course website for #=dept=# #=coursenum-sect=# 
has been created and can be accessed at the following link: 

#=url=#
 
Please let me know if any additional courses need to be linked to this class 
site (i.e. multi-listed, cross-listed, or unofficially joined courses), or if 
you notice any errors in the site.  You can reach me at 
amandaitc@humnet.ucla.edu.

As the Instructional Technology Consultant for NELC, I am available to answer 
any questions that you may have about your course website, CCLE in general, or 
any other aspect of instructional technology.  Please be aware, however, that I 
only work part-time, and if you should not receive an answer to an email in a 
timely fashion, you can email itc@humnet.ucla.edu, an account which is 
monitored every workday from 10AM to 4PM, or you can call the ITC lab at 
(310) 825-4864 (x54864 on campus).

You may notice that this course site does not appear under your regular list of 
courses at CCLE “My Sites.”  This is because CCLE is in the process of 
upgrading its underlying operating system from Moodle 1.9 to Moodle 2, and all 
Summer 2012 course websites have been built on the new system.  On June 17th, 
before instruction begins for Summer Sessions, all sites will be moved to the 
main CCLE server.  In the meantime, you can access the new site via MyUCLA 
(http://my.ucla.edu/) or the Registrar’s course website links 
(http://registrar.ucla.edu/schedule/schedulehome.aspx), in addition to the 
link above.  From the instructor’s perspective, the only major change between 
the two systems will be the process by which you reuse a previous term’s course 
website; if you are accustomed to doing that yourself, you will need to ask me 
to do it for you until the transition between the two systems is complete.

You can visit the Moodle 2 Pilot site (https://pilot.ccle.ucla.edu/) to learn 
more about the exciting new features in Moodle 2, and I’m happy to meet and 
train you individually in the system.  Alternatively, you can attend one of our 
upcoming events:

• Faculty Brown Bag Lunch on Wednesday, May 23, from 12PM to 12:50PM, in Anderson A301
• Faculty Brown Bag Lunch on Tuesday, June 19, from 12PM to 12:50PM in Public Affairs 1040
• Tuesday, June 26, from 2PM to 2:50PM in Public Affairs 1040
• Thursday, June 28, from 11AM to 11:50AM in Public Affairs 1040
 
As always, don’t hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments that you 
may have!

Sincerely,
 
Amanda Waldo
