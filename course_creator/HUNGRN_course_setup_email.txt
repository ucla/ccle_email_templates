Dear Professor #=lastname=#,

Greetings! You are receiving this email because you are the instructor of 
record for #=dept=# #=coursenum-sect=#. Your SUMMER 2013 course website has 
been created and can be accessed at the following link:

#=url=#

Please contact me if this course is cross-listed, multi-listed, or unofficially
joined to another course, and you would like one website for both Courses.
 
As your Instructional Technology Consultant (ITC), I am happy to answer any 
questions that you may have about your course website, CCLE in general, or any 
other aspect of instructional technology. Just email me at 
chrisitc@humnet.ucla.edu. Since I only work part-time, you can also usually 
reach someone on the ITC team between 10AM and 4PM on weekdays by emailing 
itc@humnet.ucla.edu or phoning 310-825-4864 (x54864 on campus).

CCLE continues to make improvements to help you and your students better 
achieve your goals. You may have already noticed the new Syllabus tool, which 
will prompt you to upload your syllabus when you first log into your course 
website. Developed at the request of the student body, this tool makes your 
syllabus easier to find for students deciding which courses to take.

Additionally, at the request of many faculty, CCLE now pushes grades directly 
to the MyUCLA Gradebook, where you may assign them to items in your MyUCLA 
grade schema. Since CDH does not manage the MyUCLA Gradebook, I can offer you 
only limited support with this feature; but please don't hesitate to ask me. 
If I can't answer your question, I'll know who can.

If you don't already know, CCLE also has the ability to restrict access to 
files and activities (such as quizzes and assignments) to specific dates and 
times. This feature can save you the trouble of manually enforcing deadlines 
or making materials available to students. Please keep in mind that if you use 
this feature, you should set times that are during our business hours (Summer 
hours: M-F, 11AM-3PM), so that we can better support your students if they 
encounter any difficulties.

Finally, I urge you to visit the CCLE Documentation page (http://docs.ccle.
ucla.edu/) to learn more about the exciting new features in Moodle 2. Our team 
continues to update this site with more text, screenshots and instructional 
videos, to assist you in getting the most out of CCLE. Iâ€™m also happy to meet 
with you for personalized CCLE training, so please don't hesitate to ask!
 
Sincerely,
