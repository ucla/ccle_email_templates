IMPORTANT REMINDER ABOUT CCLE SUPPORT FOR WINTER 2014
 
In response to your requests, we are streamlining the way we provide CCLE
support.  You can now email all of your CCLE and instructional technology 
requests to one address, ritc@humnet.ucla.edu. This account is checked 
throughout the day by our team of Research and Instructional Technology 
Consultants (RITCs).  If you have any questions about the other services that 
the RITC team can offer, you can find a description of the new program at 
http://bit.ly/RITCsupport.
 
Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions about this 
new workflow, or about the RITC program (the successor to our ITC program).
 
We're very excited to be working with you again this quarter.
 
Best regards,
 
The CDH Research & Instructional Technology Consultants (RITCs)
ritc@humnet.ucla.edu
