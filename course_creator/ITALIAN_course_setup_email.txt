Dear Prof. #=lastname=# (#=to=#):
 
Your #=nameterm=# CCLE course web site for #=dept=# #=coursenum-sect=# is:

You may login to your course with your UCLA Logon ID and password, just as
you would access your My.UCLA.
 
IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CCLE SUPPORT FOR FALL 2014
 
In mid-September, CCLE will be upgrading its core software, Moodle, to version
2.7. This may result in changes to the appearance and/or behavior of some
features in CCLE. As we learn more about what specific features will undergo
significant change, we will notify you via email.
 
As a reminder, you can now email all of your CCLE and instructional technology
requests to one address, ritc@humnet.ucla.edu. This account is checked
throughout the day by our team of Research and Instructional Technology
Consultants (RITCs).
 
Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any other questions about this
new workflow, or about the RITC program.
 
We're excited to work with you in the coming academic year!
 
Best regards,
 
The CDH Research & Instructional Technology Consultants (RITCs)
