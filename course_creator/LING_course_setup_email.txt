Dear Professor #=lastname=#,

Greetings! You are receiving this email because you are the instructor of record
for #=dept=# #=coursenum-sect=#. Your WINTER 2013 course website has been
created and can be accessed at the following link:

#=url=#

Please contact me if this course is cross-listed, multi-listed, or unofficially
joined to another course and you would like one website for both courses.

As your Instructional Technology Consultant (ITC), I am happy to answer any
questions that you may have about your course website, CCLE in general, or any
other aspect of instructional technology. Just email me at
chrisitc@humnet.ucla.edu. Since I only work part-time, you can also usually
reach someone on the ITC team between 10AM and 4PM on weekdays by emailing
itc@humnet.ucla.edu or phoning 310-825-4864 (x54864 on campus).

Because of this past summer's upgrade of the CCLE system from Moodle 1.9 to 2,
there have been changes in how to restore a previous term’s course website. If
you already know how to do so, I encourage you to try restoring your course
website yourself. However, if you encounter any difficulties, please contact me
immediately, rather than continuing to try to restore the site by yourself. I
appreciate your patience as CCLE irons out these issues. You can find all course
websites prior to Summer 2012 at https://archive.ccle.ucla.edu.

There is one more new feature in your course website this quarter: an enhanced
Syllabus tool. Added at the request of UCLA students, the "Syllabus" section now
appears on your course menu directly above Site Info when you "Turn editing on"
on your website. Via this screen, you can choose to publish your complete course
syllabus to the UCLA student body or publish an abridged "preview" syllabus
while keeping your full syllabus private for students already enrolled in your
course. Please let me know any questions that you have about this new tool.

I urge you to visit the new CCLE Documentation page (http://docs.ccle.ucla.edu/)
to learn more about the exciting new features in Moodle 2. Our team continues to
update this site with more text, screenshots and instructional videos, to assist
you in getting the most out of CCLE. I’m also happy to meet with you for
personalized CCLE training, so please don't hesitate to ask!

Sincerely,

Christopher Wood
