Dear Professor #=lastname=#,

Greetings!  You are receiving this email because you are the instructor of
record for #=dept=# #=coursenum-sect=#. Your FALL 2012 course website has been
created and can be accessed at the following link:

#=url=#

Please contact me if this course is cross-listed, multi-listed, or unofficially
joined to another course and you would like one website for both courses.

As your Instructional Technology Consultant (ITC), I am happy to answer any
questions that you may have about your course website, CCLE in general, or any
other aspect of instructional technology.  Just email me at
alexitc@humnet.ucla.edu.  Since I only work part-time, you can also always reach
someone on the ITC team between 11AM and 3PM on weekdays by emailing
itc@humnet.ucla.edu or phoning 310-825-4864 (x54864 on campus).

You may notice that this course site looks different from previous CCLE course
websites.  CCLE has recently been upgraded, and all Fall 2012 course websites
have been built on the new Moodle 2 system.  Moodle 2 brings with it many
exciting new features, including the ability to drag and drop files into a
website, connect to external file repositories like Dropbox and Google Docs, and
more easily grant access to your course websites by non-enrolled students. 
Please expect the user interface to continue changing incrementally throughout
the summer, as more of these features are tested and implemented on the CCLE
system.

One very important change is in how to restore a previous term’s course website.
Because of the upgrade, all course websites prior to Summer 2012 have been
moved to a different server, https://archive.ccle.ucla.edu.  How you access the
sites will remain unchanged; but if you want to reuse materials from one of
these sites in your current class, please contact me for assistance.

I urge you to visit the new CCLE Documentation page (http://docs.ccle.ucla.edu/)
to learn more about the exciting new features in Moodle 2; this resource will
continue to be updated throughout the summer, with the goal of being a complete
guide to CCLE by the beginning of Fall quarter.  And, of course, I’m happy to
meet and train you individually in the system.  Alternatively, you can attend
one of our upcoming Moodle 2 Information sessions:

• Monday, July 30, from 11AM to 12PM, in Public Affairs 1023
• Tuesday, August 7, from 1PM to 2PM, in Public Affairs 1023

• Monday, September 24, from 12PM to 1PM ONLINE (register via
jlynch@humnet.ucla.edu to receive the link to the webinar)
• Thursday, September 27, from 10AM to 11AM, in Public Affairs 1023

If you do intend to participate in one of these events, please email John Lynch,
our Instructional Technology Coordinator, at jlynch@humnet.ucla.edu so that we
know how many people to expect.  And, as always, don’t hesitate to contact me
with any questions or comments that you may have!

Best,
