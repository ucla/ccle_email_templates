You can now login to your course with your UCLA Logon ID and password, just as
you would access your My.UCLA.

IMPORTANT ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT CCLE SUPPORT FOR FALL 2013

In response to your requests, we are streamlining the way we provide CCLE
support. Instead of asking you to contact a specific ITC to get support, you
can now email all of your CCLE and instructional technology request needs to
one address, ritc@humnet.ucla.edu, that will be checked throughout the day by
our new team of Research and Instructional Technology Consultants (RITCs).
This should dramatically increase the rate at which we are able to respond to
your requests and eliminate the problem of support requests being overlooked.
If you have any questions about the other services that the RITC team can
offer, you can find a description of the new program at
http://bit.ly/RITCsupport.

Please expect us to be in touch again in early September with information
about the upgrades to CCLE that will be coming this Fall, as well as our slate
of CCLE training and site development opportunities. Meanwhile, please contact
us if you have any other questions about this new workflow, or about the new
RITC program (the successor to our ITC program).

We're very excited to be working with you this coming year.

Best regards,

The CDH Research & Instructional Technology Consultants (RITCs)
